# AsyncDistanceVectorCS4390
Asynchronous Distance Vector Routing 

To compile these files together, use c compiler gcc. 
gcc distance_vector.c node0.c node1.c node2.c node3.c -o file

Then, to run, just invoke file:
./file

This project was made to try and find the best routes for different nodes to 
other nodes via certain nodes. The output contains tables of output showing the
weight of the best routes avaliable at the time. 

Code done for Project2 of CS 4390 Networking
